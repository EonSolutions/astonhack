## How Does Re:Style Work?

Re:Style allows users to upload images of their clothing, which are then processed using AI to identify and categorise each piece into a digital wardrobe.

The AI model suggests outfits based on your wardrobe, factoring in usage history, personal style, and environmental conditions. To promote sustainability, users can track clothing usage, swap underused items, and explore second-hand fashion through integrated thrift store listings.
